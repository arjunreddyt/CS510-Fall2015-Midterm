This project implements the Euler method for solving ordinary differential equations and Runge Kutta method of solving differential equations of second and forth order. 
The project contains the follwing files:
1)attractor.py- The python file which contains the implemented code for Euler and Runge Kutta.
2)test_attractor.py- Test code to run nose tests.
3)ExploreAttractor.ipynb- Loads modules(mainly plots) and explains the results.
